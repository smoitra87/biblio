  abstract = {The first fully automated design and experimental validation of a
	novel sequence for an entire protein is described. A computational
	design algorithm based on physical chemical potential functions and
	stereochemical constraints was used to screen a combinatorial library
	of 1.9 × 1027 possible amino acid sequences for compatibility with
	the design target, a ββα protein motif based on the polypeptide backbone
	structure of a zinc finger domain. A BLAST search shows that the
	designed sequence, full sequence design 1 (FSD-1), has very low identity
	to any known protein sequence. The solution structure of FSD-1 was
	solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and indicates that
	FSD-1 forms a compact well-ordered structure, which is in excellent
	agreement with the design target structure. This result demonstrates
	that computational methods can perform the immense combinatorial
	search required for protein design, and it suggests that an unbiased
	and quantitative algorithm can be used in various structural contexts.},

  journal = {Journal of Computational Chemistry},

  pages = {1505--1514},

  abstract = {Recent advances in protein design have demonstrated the effectiveness
	of optimization algorithms based on the dead-end elimination theorem.
	The algorithms solve the combinatorial problem of finding the optimal
	placement of side chains for a set of backbone coordinates. Although
	they are powerful tools, these algorithms have severe limitations
	when the number of side chain rotamers is large. This is due to the
	high-order time dependence of the aspect of the calculation that
	deals with rotamer doubles. We present three independent algorithmic
	enhancements that significantly increase the speed of the doubles
	computation. These methods work by using quantities that are inexpensive
	to compute as a basis for forecasting which expensive calculations
	are worthwhile. One of the methods, the comparison of extrema, is
	derived from analytical considerations, and the remaining two, the
	“magic-bullet” and the “qrs” and “quv” metrics, are based on empirical
	observation of the distribution of energies in the system. When used
	together, these methods effect an overall speed improvement of as
	much as a factor of 47, and for the doubles aspect of the calculation,
	a factor of 95. Together, these enhancements extend the envelope
	of inverse folding to larger proteins by making formerly intractable
	calculations attainable in reasonable computer time. © 1998 John

  title = {Enhanced dead-end elimination in the search for the global minimum
	energy conformation of a collection of protein side chains},
  journal = {Protein Engineering},
  year = {1995},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {815-822},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Although the conformational states of protein side chains can be described
	using a library of rotamers, the determination of the global minimum
	energy conformation (GMEC) of a large collection of side chains,
	given fixed backbone coordinates, represents a challenging combinatorial
	problem with important applications in the field of homology modelling.
	Recently, we have developed a theoretical framework, called the dead-end
	elimination method, which allows us to identify efficiently rotamers
	that cannot be members of the GMEC. Such dead-ending rotamers can
	be iteratively removed from the system under study thereby tracking
	down the size of the combinatorial problem. Here we present new developments
	to the dead-end elimination method that allow us to handle larger
	proteins and more extensive rotamer libraries. These developments
	encompass (i) a procedure to determine weight factors in the generalized
	dead-end elimination theorem thereby enhancing the elimination of
	dead-ending rotamers and (ii) a novel strategy, mainly based on logical
	arguments derived from the logic pairs theorem, to use dead-ending
	rotamer pairs in the efficient elimination of single rotamers. These
	developments are illustrated for proteins of various sizes and the
	flow of the current method is discussed in detail. The effectiveness
	of dead-end elimination is increased by two orders of magnitude as
	compared with previous work. In addition, it now becomes feasible
	to use extremely detailed libraries. We also provide an appendix
	in which the validity of the generalized dead-end criterion is shown.
	Finally, perspectives for further applications which may now become
	within reach are discussed.},
